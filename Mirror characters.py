"""
Given a string and a number N, we need to mirror the characters from N-th position up to the length of the string in the alphabetical order. In mirror operation, we change ‘a’ to ‘z’, ‘b’ to ‘y’, and so on.

Examples:

Input : N = 3
        paradox
Output : paizwlc
We mirror characters from position 3 to end.

Input : N = 6
        pneumonia
Output : pnefnlmrz
